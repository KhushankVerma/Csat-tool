# Csat-tool
python3 tool

I don't have responsibility for any malicious use of this tool

Csat-tool brute forces birthday of a certain range as possible passwords of the site 'https://csat.allen.ac.in/'. This site is used for knowing marks and other data of a person studying at Allen carrier institute. This works because the captcha on the site can be copied.

you need the form no. of the person you want to know their marks and the year of the birthday. You can ask them or look at it in their bags

you need to install the chrome driver of your chrome version from 'https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads' before running the program

To install required files by using the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your terminal

brute forcing to gain unauthorised access is illegal!  use this if you have proper permission to do so.
