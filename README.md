# Csat-tool
python3 tool

I dont have reponsibility towords any malicious use of this tool

Csat-tool bruteforces birthday of certain range as possible passwords of the site 'https://csat.allen.ac.in/'. This site is used for knowing marks and other data of a person studing in allen cerrier institute. This works because the captcha in the site can be copied.

you need the form no. of the person you want to know there marks and the year of the birthday. You can ask them or look it in there bags

you need to install chrome driver of your chrome verson from 'https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads' before runing the program

To install required files by using command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your terminal

brute forcing to gain unauthorised access is illigal!  use this iff you have proper permission to do so.
